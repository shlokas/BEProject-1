Course Outcomes 

 

Identify the requirements for the project. 

ITP55.1 
ITP55.2  Develop a prototype to confirm technical requirement. 
ITP55.3  Design and implement the project.  
ITP55.4  Test the product.  

Minor Project-I is an opportunity to make a difference in the experience of education in its own way.  It 
is an attempt of scientific study of the problem in surrounding in order to guide, correct and evaluate the 
study  and  decisions  about  it.  Minor  project  is  based  on  small  research  project  correlating  scientific 
knowledge  and  day  to  day  experience  which  encourages  development  of  scientific  attitude  to  solve  real 
life problems among students. 
 
The Objectives of Minor Project-I are: 

✓   To make students sensitive towards societal issues 
✓   To learn scientific principles from day-to-day experiences 
✓   To develop psychotechnological skills through observation, classification, statement of 
      hypothesis etc. 
✓   Development of communication, organizational skills and maturity through discussion, 
      presentation etc. 
✓   To develop ability to correlate science, technology and society 
✓   To apply engineering knowledge and propose innovative, sustainable solutions to the real life 
      challenges 

 
Steps of Minor Research: 

✓    Keen observation of the surrounding/society 
✓    Identification of the problem 
✓    Analysis of the problem 
✓    Collection of relevant information by formulating research questions 
✓    Suggesting plan of action 
✓    Conducting experiments 
✓    To draw conclusion 
✓    To find the possible solution to rectify the problem 
✓   To execute experiments and remedial measures wherever possible

Students can seek guidance from teachers, other experts and make effective use of other sources of 
information available around them.  
Students must ensure that problem to be manageable in one semester. 
Teachers must follow the below mentioned principles: 

✓   Make student confront problem solving 
✓   Develop methods and techniques of handling problems. Teach how to use the methods and  
      not directly give solution to the problem. 
✓   Emphasize positive thinking 
✓   Lead the students to the peak of their powers for improvement of better learning. 

Criteria of a good project: 

✓   Appropriate idea, clear understanding and proper presentation of the concept 
✓   Quality of work 
✓   Project plan and its execution 
✓   Credibility of the work 
✓   Probable impact of the work on the attitude of students and society 
✓   Scientific attitude, creativity and novelty reflected in project work and analysis of the   
       situation 
✓   Utility and innovation of the remedial measures 
✓   Desirability, Feasibility and Viability in real life 

 
The H/W and S/W resources required to complete the Minor Project-I may be beyond the scope of 
curriculum of courses taken or may be based on the courses but thrust should be on  

•   Learning additional skills  
•   Development of ability to define and design the problem and lead to its accomplishment with  
     proper planning  
•   Learn the behavioral discipline by working in a team. The team may be maximum three (03)    
     students. 

 
Evaluation: 
Project report should be submitted on A-4 size pages. Use both printing. Report must carry project 
title, student details, certificate and acknowledgements. Other sections of the report shall be decided 
by the department based on projects. But it must have introduction, necessity of project, objectives, 
hypothesis (“If I do….then I may get….”), plan, observations, and analysis of results, conclusion and 
references along with other sections related to technology. 
The ISE and ESE evaluation will be carried out based on the rubrics framed by the Department. ISE 
marks will be based on the performance of the individual student in two phases of evaluation. The 
evaluation of the Phase-I will be based on presentation of the  market/environment/context/literature 
survey, problem formulation, Problem definition and project title finalization. Phase-II evaluation is 
based on Feasible solutions for the problem, Remedial measures and its demonstration, presentation 
and technical report.  
The ESE marks will be based on demonstration in front of the expert appointed by the Department. 
In  the  ESE  examination  each  individual  student  would  be  assessed  for  his/her  contribution  in 
selecting  the  originality  of  the  problem  statement,  understanding  and  knowledge  gained  about  the 
task  completed  through  presentation/demonstration,  work  done,  and  preparing  the  technical 
report/poster/technical paper of the project in the standard format provided by the department.

ABL3: Creative Thinking, Diversity and Workplace Etiquette 

 
I.  Creative Thinking: 

Organizations  thrive  on  innovative  ideas  and  new  answers  to  old  problems.  To  become 
successful not  only these approaches be fresh, they must also  be sound.  This  activity shall 
inspire  students  to  push  them  for  critical  thinking  and  decision  making.    Students  may  be 
asked  to  provide  innovative  solutions  to  specific  issues  within  the  organization  to  meet 
business  needs.  Through  this  activity  students  shall  learn  how  to  step  out  of  their  comfort 
zone,  able  to  isolate  problems,  recognize  differences  between  left  brain  and  right  brain 
thinking, and apply creative thinking techniques to business problems.  

 
II. Diversity: 

Nowadays students are becoming global and degree from an accredited institute is considered 
as „Educational  Passport‟ hence it is  necessary to  include training on diversity. Training on 
working in a culturally diverse team to prepare students for an international work is required.  
A better understanding of others can improve communication, encourage engagement, reduce 
inappropriate behavior and increase the strength  of a team. A strategy of inclusion can also 
help employees realize their full workplace potential. Activities shall be planned for diversity 
awareness, 
style 
pRecommended  Books  and  tactics  for  managing  heterogeneous  teams.  Igniting  thought 
provoking  questions  and  conversations  related  to  diversity  in  race,  gender,  culture,  age  and 
other observable differences shall be fundamental to this activity. Activity shall also address 
cognitive biases which are influences that cause us to make decisions based on information 
outside of logic and rational thinking for example behavioral partiality and social favoritism. 

communicational 

unconscious 

bias, 

generational 

differences, 

 
III. Workplace Etiquette: 

Organizations  expect  that  employees  are  aware  of  workplace  expectations  and  etiquette. 
While  the  use  of  good  business  etiquette  will  not  make  up  for  technical  knowledge  in  the 
workplace but bad manners and poor etiquette can cost both employees and organizations for 
which they work.  This activity shall focus on ins and outs of business etiquette by managing 
technology  and  social  media  effectively.  Activity  shall  be  based  on  Cell  phone  etiquette, 
Email  etiquette,  social  media  etiquette,  board  meeting  etiquette,  sales  meeting  etiquette, 
business  dressing  and  dining  skills,  international  manners  along  with  exceptional  etiquette 
like hosting corporate guests, interacting with public or customers and business networking.

ITP65.2  List the requirements.  
ITP65.3  Select one from alternate solution. 
ITP65.4  Write survey paper. 

ISE:  
The main intention of Minor Project  is  to  apply the software engineering  principles and practices  to 
solve social issues.  Rigurous requirement gathering is done and documented.  Hence the preliminary 
study of the final year project is done here.   
 
Minor Project contains:- 
1)  Problem identification and analysis 
2)  Requirement gathering 
3)  Feasibility study  
4)  Alternate solution 
5)  Selection of technologies and tools 
6)  Prototype design  
7)  Architectural diagram 
 
Evaluation: 
The team will be maximum of 3 students.  Project report should be submitted on A-4 size pages. Use 
both printing. Report must carry project title, student details, certificate and acknowledgements. Other 
sections  of  the  report  shall  be  decided  by  the  department  based  on  projects.  But  it  must  have 
introduction,  necessity  of  project,  objectives,  hypothesis  (“If  I  do….then  I  may  get….”),  plan, 
observations,  and  analysis  of  results,  conclusion  and  references  along  with  other  sections  related  to 
technology. 
The ISE and ESE evaluation will be carried out based on the rubrics framed by the Department. ISE 
marks  will  be  based  on  the  performance  of  the  individual  student  in  two  phases  of  evaluation.  The 
evaluation of the Phase-I will be based on presentation of the   market/environment/context/literature 
survey,  problem  formulation,  Problem  definition  and  project  title  finalization.  Phase-II  evaluation  is

Course Overview (Theory): 
This open elective course is designed to introduce the concepts of computational intelligence and its 
application. It is structured to give students an overview of three fundamental topics which form the 
basis of Computational Intelligence: neural networks, fuzzy logic, natural language processing, and 
statistics. Students will be able to understand the working of different types of models according to 
different  types  of  training.  Fuzzy  logic  is  included  to  enable  students  to  design  their  own  fuzzy 
control systems using all the various concepts taught. They will also learn about the basics and steps 
involved  in  Natural  Language  Processing  which  can  be  employed  in  most  applications.  To  learn 
about which method fits their data set best, they will be introduced to the application of statistics to 
computational  intelligence.  Thus  this  open  elective  is  focus  on  inspiration,  design,  theory,  and 
practical aspects of implementing procedures to solve real-world problems. 

The concepts taught in the theory must be implemented in the form of various problem statements in 
the practical. There will be four experiments based on supervised learning, CNN, Fuzzy controllers 
and  model-fit  calculation  techniques.  Emphasis  is  given  to  the  mini-project  which  carries  a  high 
weightage. Students are required to implement most of the concepts learned throughout the practical 
in the mini-project by selecting a suitable problem statement. The mini-project will be graded at two 
stages. Special emphasis is given to the mini-project at the end of the practical sessions which will 
be based on computational intelligence.
